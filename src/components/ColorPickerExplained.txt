   - We import the necessary modules, including useState from React 
   and styled from styled-components.

   -  We define the ColorPicker functional component that returns 
   JSX. This component takes two props: colors and onChange.

    - We use the useState hook to initialize the selectedColor 
    state variable to the first color in the colors array.

    - We define the handleColorClick function that takes a color 
    argument and sets the selectedColor state variable to that color.

    - We define the Color styled component, which is a div element 
    that has a background-color property that is set to the color prop.

    - We define the ColorWrapper styled component, which is a div element 
    that has a display property set to flex, and we use it to wrap each 
    Color component.

    - We return the ColorPicker component, which maps over the colors
    prop and renders a Color component for each color. We pass the color 
    and selectedColor state variable to each Color component, and we use 
    the handleColorClick function as the click handler for each Color 
    component.

    - We also render a div element that displays the currently selected 
    color using the selectedColor state variable.

REACT CHANGE EVENT EXPLAINED:

    const handleColorChange = (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    setColor(event.target.value);
  };

    - In React, forms are often used to collect user input. When a user 
    types something into an input field, a change event is triggered.
    React provides a type called ChangeEvent that we can use to define the 
    type of event object being passed to the event handler function.

    - In this code, handleColorChange is an event handler function that is 
    called whenever the user changes the value of the color input field. 
    event is the argument passed to the function, which is an instance of 
    the ChangeEvent type.

    - The input field has a value attribute that holds the current value 
    of the input field, which in this case is the color selected by the 
    user. event.target.value refers to the value of the element that 
    triggered the event, in this case the color input field.

    - setColor is a state updater function, which sets the color state 
    variable to the value of the color input field. In this way, the 
    component is able to update the color being displayed in real time as 
    the user selects a new color.
