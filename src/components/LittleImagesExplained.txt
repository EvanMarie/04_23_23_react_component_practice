   LITTLE IMAGES CODE EXPLANATION:
   
    - The interface MenuItemProps defines the type of each object that will 
    be in the menuItems array. It has four properties: text (a string 
    representing the name of the item), onClick (a function that will be 
    called when the item is clicked), active (a boolean indicating whether or 
    not the item is currently active), and image (a string representing the
    URL of the image for the item).

    - The LittleImages component is defined, which contains the state for 
    the menuItems array and the selectedItem string using useState.

    - The MenuWrapper and MenuItem styled components are defined using 
    styled-components. MenuWrapper is a ul that will hold all of the menu 
    items, and MenuItem is an li representing each individual menu item. 
    active is a prop that is passed to MenuItem to determine whether or 
    not the item is currently active.

    - The Selected styled component is defined, which will display the 
    selected item's image.

    - The handleItemClick function is defined to handle when a menu item 
    is clicked. It takes the index of the clicked item as an argument and 
    sets the active property of the corresponding menuItems object to true, 
    and all other objects to false. It then sets the selectedItem state to 
    the image URL of the clicked item.

    - The menuItems array is mapped over in the MenuWrapper JSX element to
    create the menu items. Each MenuItem is passed a key and an onClick 
    function that calls handleItemClick with the index of the item. The 
    active prop is passed to each MenuItem based on the active property 
    of its corresponding object in the menuItems array. The text for each 
    item is rendered as a child of the MenuItem.

    - The Selected JSX element is rendered if selectedItem state is not 
    an empty string. The img element is passed the src attribute with 
    the value of selectedItem and the alt attribute with the value of 
    "Selected Item".

    - The LittleImages component is exported as the default export of 
    the file.
